# AWS SageMaker Mobile Price Prediction 📱

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** on **AWS SageMaker** — from data preprocessing to model deployment.

The goal is to build and deploy a **Random Forest classifier** that predicts the **price range of mobile phones** based on hardware specifications such as battery power, RAM, and screen resolution.

## ⚙️ Setup Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.9
conda create -p myvenv python=3.11

# Activate the environment
conda activate ./myvenv

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
